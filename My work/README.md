# Program 1: Net salary calculator

# Description:

This program prompts users to input their basic salary and benefits. It then computes and provides information on gross pay, tax deductions, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and net pay based on the entered values.

# Program 2: Speed detector

# Description:

The program is designed to determine a driver's speed and assess whether it exceeds the speed limit. If the speed is 70 km/s or below, the program displays 'ok.' For speeds above 70 km/s, demerit points are calculated at a rate of 1 point per every 5 km/s above 70. If the demerit points are below 12, the program outputs the total demerit points. However, if the demerit points equal or exceed 12, the message 'license suspended' is displayed.

# Program 3: Student grade generator

Description:
The program is designed to determine a driver's speed and assess whether it exceeds the speed limit. If the speed is 70 km/s or below, the program displays 'ok.' For speeds above 70 km/s, demerit points are calculated at a rate of 1 point per every 5 km/s above 70. If the demerit points are below 12, the program outputs the total demerit points. However, if the demerit points equal or exceed 12, the message 'license suspended' is displayed.
